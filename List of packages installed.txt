haxelib run flixel-tools setup

To set the tools up initially / to be able to use the flixel alias in your console:
haxelib run flixel-tools setup
https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/flixel-tools/

haxelib install flixel-addons
https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/flixel-addons/


To test:
lime test html5
* Use whatever platform you want in the third value there in the command line


Used this to set up the main menu:

I want to use this to set up player movement:

I could use this to learn about sprites and music at least:

EZPlatformer is a game project that I could probably learn from, but it was created 11 years ago, meaning there must be some better methods of programming since then:
https://github.com/AdamAtomic/EZPlatformer/blob/master/src/PlayState.as

This game has better movement and jumping physics, so I might use it as a better example. It also has a sprite as the main character rather than a simple block:

This game is probably the most complex platformer so far, even having some features I probably don't need:
https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-demos/tree/dev/Platformers/ProjectJumper/source

This page has a lot of demos that I can use to learn about various features, but the main ones I see are tooltips and transitions:

An example of how to use FlxFSM - says it's a little simpler than the demo from the haxeFlixel site:

For optimization, try bundling a lot of objects together using an FlxGroup (or even bundling groups together)


For 16x9 aspect ratio, I need to make the width and height something like 960x540 (Exactly half of 1920x1080)


I could use the antialiasing boolean here to possibly improve the look of sprites. I would need to keep that configuration setting toggleable somewhere else though.

There are some cool functions in here for accelerating an object toward the mouse cursor:
